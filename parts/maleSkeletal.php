					</div>
					<div class="modal-body">

						</div>
						<p>
							A limb girdle is defined as the bones that connect a limb to the axial skeleton. The bones of the pectoral or shoulder girdle are the clavicle and scapula. Only one small joint connects the girdle to the rest of the skeleton: the sternoclavicular joint, and the two bones are joined to one another by an even smaller joint, the acromioclavicular. The remaining attachment to the axial skeleton is purely muscular, and this helps to account for the greater mobility of the shoulder girdle compared with its lower limb counterpart, where three bones (ilium, ischium and pubis) fuse to form the solid hip bone or pelvic girdle.<br/><br/>
							In terms of comparative anatomy, the human scapula represents two bones that have become fused together; the (dorsal) scapula proper and the (ventral) coracoid. The epiphyseal line across the glenoid cavity is the line of fusion. They are the counterparts of the ilium and ischium of the pelvic girdle. The counterpart of the pubis is a tiny piece of bone (precoracoid) that ossifies separately at the tip of the coracoid process; it takes no part in the formation of the shoulder joint. The clavicle, ossifying in membrane, is an added bone (it has no counterpart in the pelvic girdle) whose purpose is to act as a strut preventing medial movement of the scapula. The strong coracoclavicular ligament attaches the clavicle and scapula to each other, and the clavicle is anchored to the first costal cartilage by the costo¬clavicular ligament. Forces from the upper limb are transmitted by the clavicle to the axial skeleton through these ligaments, and neither end of the clavicle normally transmits much force. <br/>
							<h2>Embryology of pectoral girdle:</h2> <br/>
							Muscles developed in the upper limb are supplied by branches from the brachial plexus. During their devel¬opment some of these muscles migrate for considerable distances to gain attachment to the trunk; but they continue to be innervated from the brachial plexus. Motor supply, once established in the embryo, never changes thereafter. An example is latissimus dorsi which, notwithstanding its very wide attachment to the trunk, still retains its supply from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. Other muscles, not developed in the limb, migrate from the trunk and gain attachment to the girdle; e.g. sternocleidomastoid and trapezius, supplied by the accessory nerve, attach themselves to clavicle and scapula. The nerve supply tells the story of the development of any muscle. <br/>
							<h2>Movements of the pectoral girdle:</h2> <br/>
							The essential functional requirement of the pectoral girdle is mobility on the thorax to enhance the mobility of the shoulder joint. And it is a fact that all movement between humerus and glenoid cavity, except very slight movement, is accompanied by an appropriate movement of the scapula itself. Nor can the scapula move without making its supporting strut, the clavicle, move also. Generally speaking the shoulder joint, the acromioclav¬icular and sternoclavicular joints all move together in harmony, providing a kind of thoracohumeral articu-lation. It is important to appreciate this, for functional defects in any part of the ‘thoracohumeral articulation’ must impair the whole. <br/>
							<h2>Muscles of the pectoral girdle:</h2> <br/>
							The muscular attachments between pectoral girdle and trunk are direct and indirect. Direct attachment of the pectoral girdle to the trunk is provided by muscles that are inserted into the clavicle or scapula from the axial skeleton. These muscles are pectoralis minor, subclavius, trapezius, the rhomboids, levator scapulae and serratus anterior. Indirect attach¬ment to the axial skeleton is secured by the great muscles of the axillary folds (pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi); these muscles, by way of the upper end of the humerus, move the pectoral girdle on the trunk. Their descriptions are included here. <br/><br/>
							The muscular attachments between upper limb and pectoral girdle include the deltoid and short scapular muscles, which are inserted about the upper end of the humerus, and the biceps and long head of triceps which, running over the humerus, are inserted beyond the elbow joint into the bones of the forearm. All these muscles are important factors in giving stability to the very mobile shoulder joint across which they lie, and are described with the shoulder region.

						<h4 class="modal-title">UPPER LIMB</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="modal-body">
						<div align = center>
							
						</div>
						<p>
							<b> Upper Limb </b> is characterized by its mobility and ability to grasp, strike, and conduct fine motor skills (manipulation). These characteristics are especially marked in the hand. Efficiency of hand function results in a large part from the ability to place it in the proper position by movements at the scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, elbow, radio-ulnar, and wrist joints. <br/><br/>
							The upper limb consists of four segments, which are further subdivided into regions. <br/><br/>
							•	<b>Shoulder</b>, which includes the pectoral, scapular, and lateral supraclavicular regions. The pectoral (shoulder) girdle is a bony ring, incomplete posteriorly, formed by the scapulae and clavicles and completed anteriorly by the manubrium of the sternum. <br/>
							•	<b>Arm</b> (L. brachium) is between the shoulder and the elbow and is centered around the humerus. It consists of the anterior and posterior regions of the arm. <br/>
							•	<b>Forearm</b> (L. antebrachium) is between the elbow and the wrist and contains the ulna and radius. It consists of the anterior and posterior regions of the forearm. <br/>
							•	<b>Hand</b> (L. manus) is distal to the forearm and contains the carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges. It is composed of the wrist, palm, dorsum of hand, and digits (fingers, including the opposable thumb), and is richly supplied with sensory endings for touch, pain, and temperature. <br/><br/>
							<h2> Bones of Upper Limb </h2><br/>
							The pectoral girdle and bones of the free part of the upper limb form the superior appendicular skeleton, which articulates with the axial skeleton only at the sternoclavicular joint, allowing great mobility. The pectoral girdle is supported, stabilized, and propelled by axioappendicular muscles, which attach to the ribs, sternum, and vertebrae of theaxial skeleton. <br/><br/>
							<h2>Clavicle</h2><br/>
							<b>Clavicle</b>(collar bone) connects the upper limb to the trunk. Its sternal end articulates with the manubrium of the sternumat the sternoclavicular (SC) joint. Its acromial end articulates with the acromion of the scapula at the acromioclavicular (AC) joint.  The medial two thirds of the shaft of the clavicle are convex anteriorly, whereas the lateral third is flattened and concave anteriorly. These curvatures increase the resilience of the clavicle and give it the appearance of an elongated capital S. The clavicle: <br/><br/>
							•	Serves as a strut (rigid support) from which the scapula and free limb are suspended, keeping the limb away from the thorax so that the arm has maximum freedom of motion. Fixing the strut in position, especially after its elevation, enables elevation of the ribs for deep inspiration. <br/>
							•	Forms one of the boundaries of the cervicoaxillary canal(passageway between neck and arm), affording protection to the neurovascular bundle supplying the upper limb. <br/>
							•	Transmits shocks (traumatic impacts) from the upper limb to the axial skeleton. <br/><br/>

							<h2>Scapula</h2><br/>
							<b>Scapula </b>(shoulder blade) is a triangular flat bone that lies on the posterolateral aspect of the thorax, overlying the second through seventh ribs. The convex posterior surface of the scapula is unevenly divided by the spine of the scapula into a small supraspinous fossaand a much larger infraspinous fossa. The concave costal surface of the scapula has a large subscapular fossa. The triangular body of the scapula is thin and translucent superior and inferior to the scapular spine. <br/><br/>
							The scapula has medial (axillary), lateral (vertebral), andsuperior borders and superior and inferior angles. The lateral border of scapula is the thickest part of the bone, which includes the head of the scapula where the glenoid cavity is located. The neck of the scapula is just inferior to the head (Fig. 6.4B). The superior border of the scapula is marked near the junction of its medial two thirds and lateral third by the suprascapular notch. <br/><br/>
							The spine of the scapula continues laterally as the flat expanded acromion, which forms the subcutaneous point of the shoulder and articulates with the acromial end of the clavicle. <br/><br/>
							Superolaterally, the lateral surface of the scapula has aglenoid cavity, which articulates with the head of the humerus at the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. The glenoid (G. socket) cavity is a shallow, concave, oval fossa, which is directed anterolaterally and slightly superiorly and is considerably smaller than the head of the humerus for which it serves as a socket. The beak-like coracoid process is superior to the glenoid cavity and projects anterolaterally. <br/>
							
							<h2>Humerus</h2><br/>
							<b>Humerus </b>(arm bone), the largest bone in the upper limb, articulates with the scapula at the glenohumeral joint and the radius and ulna at the elbow joint.
							 Proximally, the ball-shaped head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The intertubercular sulcus(bicipital groove) of the proximal end of the humerus separates the lesser tubercle from the greater tubercle. Just distal to the humeral head, the anatomical neck of the humerus separates the head from the tubercles. Distal to the tubercles is the narrow surgical neck of the humerus. <br/><br/>
							The shaft of the humerus has two prominent features: the deltoid tuberosity laterally and the radial groove (groove for radial nerve, spiral groove) posteriorly for the radial nerve and deep artery of the arm. The inferior end of the humeral shaft widens as the sharp medial and lateral supra-epicondylar (supracondylar) ridges form and then end distally in the prominent medial epicondyle and lateral epicondyle. <br/><br/>
							The distal end of the humerus, including the trochlea, capitulum, olecranon, coronoid, and radial fossae, makes up the condyle of the humerus. It has two articular surfaces: a lateral capitulum (L. little head) for articulation with the head of the radius and a medial trochlea (L. pulley) for articulation with the trochlear notch of the ulna. Superior to the trochlea anteriorly is the coronoid fossa, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna during full flexion of the elbow. Posteriorly, the olecranon fossaaccommodates the olecranon of the ulna during extension of the elbow. Superior to the capitulum anteriorly, the shallowradial fossa accommodates the edge of the head of the radius when the elbow is fully flexed. <br/><br/>
							
							<h2>Ulna and Radius</h2><br/>
							<b> Ulna</b>, the stabilizing bone of the forearm, is the medial and longer of the two forearm bones. Its proximal end has two prominent projections—the olecranonposteriorly and the coronoid process anteriorly; they form the walls of the trochlear notch. The trochlear notch of the ulna articulates with the trochlea of the humerus. Inferior to the coronoid process is the tuberosity of the ulna. On the lateral side of the coronoid process is a smooth, rounded concavity, the radial notch, which articulates with the head of radius. <br/><br/>
							Distal to the radial notch is a prominent ridge, the supinator crest, and between it and the distal part of the coronoid process is a concavity, the supinator fossa.Proximally, the shaft of the ulna is thick, but it tapers, diminishing in diameter distally. At its narrow distal end is the rounded head of ulna with the small, conical ulnar styloid process. <br/><br/>
							The ulna does not articulate directly with the carpal bones. It is separated from the carpals by a fibrocartilaginous articular disc. <br/><br/>
							
							<b>Radius</b> is the lateral and shorter of the two forearm bones. Its proximal end consists of a cylindrical head, a short neck, and a projection from the medial surface, the radial tuberosity. Proximally, the smooth superior aspect of the head of the radius is concave for articulation with the capitulum of humerus. The head also articulates medially with the radial notch of ulna. The neck of the radius is the narrow part between the head and the radial tuberosity. The radial tuberosity demarcates the proximal end (head and neck) from the shaft. <br/><br/>
							The shaft of the radius has a lateral convexity and gradually enlarges as it passes distally. The medial aspect of the distal end of the radius forms a concavity, the ulnar notch, which accommodates the head of the ulna. Its lateral aspect terminates distally as the radial styloid process. The radial styloid process is larger than the ulnar styloid process and extends farther distally. The dorsal tubercle of the radiuslies between two of the shallow grooves for passage of the tendons of forearm muscles.<br/>
							<h2>Bones of Hand</h2><br/>
							<b>Wrist</b> or <b> Carpus</b>, is composed of eight carpal bones(carpals) arranged in proximal and distal rows of four (Figs. 6.8 and 6.9). These small bones give flexibility to the wrist. The carpus is markedly convex from side to side posteriorly and concave anteriorly. Augmenting movement at the wrist, the two rows of carpals glide on each other; each carpal also glides on those adjacent to it. The proximal surfaces of the proximal row of carpals articulate with the inferior end of the radius and the articular disc of the wrist joint. The distal surfaces of these bones articulate with the distal row of carpals. <br/><br/>
							<b>From lateral to medial, the four bones in the proximal row of carpals are the:</b> <br/>
							•	<b>Scaphoid (G. skaphé, skiff, boat):</b> a boat-shaped bone that has a prominent scaphoid tubercle. <br/>
							•	<b>Lunate (L. luna, moon):</b> a moon-shaped bone that is broader anteriorly than posteriorly. <br/>
							•	<b>Triquetrum (L. triquetrus, three-cornered):</b> a pyramidal bone on the medial aspect of the carpus. <br/>
							•	<b>Pisiform (L. pisum, pea):</b> a small, pea-shaped bone that lies on the palmar surface of the triquetrum. <br/><br/>
							The proximal surfaces of the distal row of carpals articulate with the proximal row of carpals, and their distal surfaces articulate with the metacarpals. From lateral to medial, the four bones in the distal row of carpals are the: <br/>
							•	<b>Trapezium (G. trapeze, table):</b> a four-sided bone on the lateral side of the carpus. <br/>
							•	<b>Trapezoid:</b> a wedge-shaped bone that resembles a trapezium. <br/>
							•	<b>Capitate (L. caput, head):</b> the head-shaped bone that is the largest bone in the carpus. <br/>
							•	<b>Hamate (L. hamulus, a little hook):</b> a wedge-shaped bone, which has a hooked process, the hook of hamate, that extends anteriorly. <br/><br/>
							<b>Metacarpus </b> forms the skeleton of the palm of the hand between the carpus and the phalanges. It is composed of five metacarpal bones. Each metacarpal consists of a base, shaft, and head. The proximal bases of the metacarpals articulate with the carpal bones, and the distal heads of the metacarpals articulate with the proximal phalanges and form the knuckles. The first metacarpal (of the thumb) is the thickest and shortest of these bones. <br/>
							Each digit has three phalanges (proximal, middle, and distal) except for the first (thumb), which has only two (proximal and distal). Each phalanx has a base proximally, a shaft (body), and a head distally. The distal phalanges are flattened and expanded at their distal ends, which underlie the nail beds.

						</div>
						<p>
							<b>Lower Limbs</b> (extremities) are specialized for locomotion, supporting body weight, and maintaining balance. The lower limbs are connected to the trunk by the pelvic girdle, a bony ring composed of the sacrum and right and left hip bones joined anteriorly at the pubic symphysis (L. symphysis pubis). <br/><br/>
							<b>The lower limb has six major regions: </b><br/>
							1.	<b>Gluteal region (L. regio glutealis)</b> is the transitional zone between the trunk and free lower limbs. It includes thebuttocks (L. nates, clunes) and hip region (L. regio coxae), which overlies the hip joint and greater trochanter of the femur. <br/>
							2.	<b>Femoral region (L. regio femoris)</b>, also referred to as the thigh, contains most of the femur, which connects the hip and knee joints. <br/>
							3.	<b>Knee region (L. regio genus)</b> contains the distal femur, the proximal tibia and fibula, and the patella (knee cap) as well as the joints between these bony structures; the fatfilled hollow posterior to the knee (L. poples) is called thepopliteal fossa. <br/>
							4.	<b>Leg region (L. regio cruris)</b> connects the knee and ankle joints and contains the tibia and fibula; the calf (L. sura) of the leg is the posterior prominence. Often laypersons refer incorrectly to the entire lower limb as “the leg.” <br/>
							5.	<b>Ankle or talocrural region (L. regio talocruralis)</b> includes the narrow distal part of the leg and ankle (talocrural) joint. <br/>
							6.	<b>Foot region (L. regio pedis)</b>, the distal part of the lower limb, contains the tarsus, metatarsus, andphalanges (toe bones). The superior surface is the dorsum of the foot, and the inferior, ground-contacting surface is the sole or plantar region. The toes are the digits of the foot; the great toe (L.hallux) has only two phalanges, and the other digits have three.<br/><br/>

							<h2>Bones of Lower Limb</h2></br>
							Body weight is transferred from the vertebral column through the sacro-iliac joints to the pelvic girdle and from the pelvic girdle through the hip joints to the femurs (L. femora) and then through the femurs to the knee joints. Weight is then transferred from the knee joint to the ankle joint by the tibia. The fibula does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight. At the ankle, the weight is transferred to the talus. The talus is the keystone of a longitudinal arch formed by the tarsal and metatarsal bones of each foot, which distribute the weight evenly between the heel and the forefoot when standing. To support the erect bipedal posture better, the femurs are oblique (directed inferomedially) within the thighs so that when standing the knees are adjacent and are placed directly inferior to the trunk, returning the center of gravity to the vertical lines of the supporting legs and feet. The femurs of females are slightly more oblique than those of males, reflecting the greater width of their pelves. <br/><br/>
							<h2>Hip Bone</h2><br/>
							<b>Hip Bone</b> is formed by the fusion of three primary bones: ilium, ischium, and pubis. At puberty, these bones are still separated by a triradiate cartilage. The cartilage disappears and the bones begin to fuse at 15 to 17 years of age; fusion is complete between 20 and 25 years of age. <br/>
							<b>Ilium</b>, the superior and largest part of the hip bone, contributes to the superior part of the acetabulum, the cup-like cavity (socket) on the lateral aspect of the hip bone for articulation with the head of the femur. The ilium consists of a body, which joins the pubis and ischium to the acetabulum, and an ala (wing), which is bordered superiorly by the iliac crest. <br/>
							<b>Ischium</b> forms the posteroinferior part of the acetabulum and hip bone. The ischium consists of a body, where it joins the ilium and superior ramus of the pubis to form the acetabulum. The ramus of the ischium joins the inferior ramus of the pubis to form the ischiopubic ramus. <br/>
							<b>Pubis</b> forms the anterior part of the acetabulum and the anteromedial part of the hip bone. The right pubis has abody that articulates with the left pubis at the pubic symphysis. It also has two rami, superior and inferior. <br/><br/>
							<b>To place the hip bone or bony pelvis in the anatomical position, situate it so that the:</b><br/>
							•	Anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and anterosuperior aspect of the pubis lie in the same coronal (frontal) plane.</br>
							•	Symphysial surface of the pubis is vertical, parallel to the median plane. </br>
							•	Internal aspect of the body of the pubis faces almost directly superiorly. </br>
							•	Acetabulum faces inferolaterally, with the acetabular notch directed inferiorly. </br>
							•	Obturator foramen lies inferomedial to the acetabulum. </br></br>
							<h2>Femur</h2></br>
							•	<b>Femur</b> is the longest and heaviest bone in the body. The femur consists of a shaft (body) and superior or proximal and inferior or distal ends. Most of the shaft is smoothly rounded, except for a prominent double-edged ridge on its posterior aspect, the linea aspera, which diverges inferiorly. The proximal end of the femur consists of a head, neck, and greater and lesser trochanters. The head of the femur is covered with articular cartilage, except for a medially placed depression or pit, the fovea for the ligament of the head. The neck of the femur is trapezoidal; the narrow end supports the head and its broader base is continuous with the shaft. </br>
							•	Where the neck joins the shaft are two large, blunt elevations—the trochanters. The conical lesser trochanter, with its rounded tip, extends medially from the posteromedial part of the junction of the femoral neck and shaft. The greater trochanter is a large, laterally placed mass that projects superomedially where the neck joins the shaft. The intertrochanteric line is a roughened ridge running from the greater to the lesser trochanter. A similar but smoother ridge, the intertrochanteric crest, joins the trochanters posteriorly. </br>
							•	The distal end of the femur ends in two spirally curved femoral condyles (medial and lateral). The femoral condyles articulate with the tibial condyles to form the knee joint. </br>
							•	The proximal femur is bent (L-shaped) so that the long axis of the head and neck project superomedially at an angle to that of the obliquely oriented shaft. This obtuse angle of inclination in the adult is 115 to 140 degrees, averaging 126 degrees. The angle is less in females because of the increased width between the acetabula and the greater obliquity of the shaft. The angle of inclination allows greater mobility of the femur at the hip joint because it places the head and neck more perpendicular to the acetabulum. This is advantageous for bipedal walking; however, it imposes considerable strain on the neck of the femur. Fractures of the neck may occur in older people as a result of a slight stumble if the neck has been weakened by osteoporosis. </br></br>
							<h2>Angle of inclination and torsion angle of femur.</h2></br>
							•	When the femur is viewed superiorly, so that the proximal end is superimposed over the distal end, it can be seen that the axis of the head and neck of the femur and the transverse axis of the femoral condyles intersect at the long axis of the shaft of the femur forming the torsion angle, or angle of declination. The mean torsion angle is 7 degrees in males and 12 degrees in females. The torsion angle, combined with the angle of inclination, allows rotatory movements of the femoral head within the obliquely placed acetabulum to convert into flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, and rotational movements of the thigh. </br></br>

							<h2>Patella</h2></br>
							The patella (knee cap) is a large sesamoid bone that is formed intratendinously after birth. This triangular bone, located anterior to the knee joint, articulates with the patellar surface of the femur. The subcutaneous anterior surface of the patella is convex; the thick base (superior border) slopes inferoanteriorly; the two lateral and medial borders converge inferiorly to form the pointed apex; and thearticular surface (posterior surface) has a smooth articular area that is divided into medial and lateral articular surfaces by a vertical ridge. </br></br>
							<h2>Tibia</h2></br>
							The large, weight-bearing tibia (shin bone) articulates with the femoral condyles superiorly, the talus inferiorly, and the fibula laterally at its proximal and distal ends. The distal end of the tibia is smaller than the proximal end and has facets for articulation with the fibula and talus. </br>
							<b>Medial malleolus</b> is an inferiorly directed projection from the medial side of the distal end of the tibia. The largenutrient foramen of the tibia is located on the posterior aspect of the proximal third of the bone. From it, the nutrient canal runs inferiorly in the tibia before it opens into the medullary (marrow) cavity. </br></br>
							<h2>Fibula</h2></br>
							The slender <b>fibula</b> lies posterolateral to the tibia and serves mainly for muscle attachment. At its proximal end the fibula consists of an enlarged head superior to a narrow neck. At its distal end, the fibula enlarges to form the lateral malleolus, which is more prominent and more posteriorly placed than the medial malleolus and extends approximately 1 cm farther distally. The fibula is not directly involved in weight bearing; however, its lateral malleolus helps hold the talus in its socket. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are connected by an interosseous membranethroughout most of their lengths. </br></br>
							<h2>Tarsus, Metatarsus, and Phalanges</h2></br>
							The bones of the foot include the tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges. </br></br>
							<h2>TARSUS </h2></br>
							The tarsus consists of seven bones: calcaneus, talus, cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiforms. Only the talus articulates with the leg bones. The calcaneus (heel bone) is the largest and strongest bone in the foot. It articulates with the talus superiorly and the cuboid anteriorly. The calcaneus transmits most of the body weight from the talus to the ground. </br></br>
							The <b>sustentaculum tali</b>, projecting from the superior border of the medial surface of the calcaneus, supports the head of the talus. The lateral surface of the calcaneus has an oblique ridge. </br>
							The <b>Fibular trochlea</b>. The posterior part of the calcaneus has a prominence, the calcaneal tuberosity (L. tuber calcanei), which has medial, lateral, and anterior tubercles. </br>
							The <b>Talus </b>(ankle bone) has a head, neck, and body. The talus rests on the anterior two thirds of the calcaneus. The superior surface, the trochlea of the talus, bears the weight of the body transmitted from the tibia and articulates with the two malleoli. The head of the talus articulates anteriorly with the navicular. The rounded head of talus rests partially on the sustentaculum tali (talar shelf) of the calcaneus. </br>
							The <b>Navicular </b>(L. little ship), a flattened, boat-shaped bone, is located between the talar head and the cuneiforms. The medial surface of the navicular projects inferiorly as the tuberosity of navicular. If the tuberosity is too prominent, it may press against the medial part of the shoe and cause foot pain. </br>
							The <b>Cuboid</b> is the most lateral bone in the distal row of the tarsus. Anterior to the tuberosity of cuboid, on the lateral and plantar surfaces of the bone, is a groove for the tendon of the fibularis longus muscle. </br></br>
							There are three cuneiforms: medial (first), intermediate (second), and lateral (third). Each cuneiform (L. cuneus, wedge-shaped) articulates with the navicular posteriorly and the base of the appropriate metatarsal anteriorly. In addition, the lateral cuneiform articulates with the cuboid. </br>
							•	Femoral Fractures
							•	Coxa Vara and Coxa Valga </br></br>
							<h2>METATARSUS</h2></br>
							The <b>metatarsus</b> consists of five metatarsals, which connect the tarsus and phalanges. They are numbered from the medial side of the foot. 
							The <b>first metatarsal</b> is shorter and stouter than the others. </br>
							 The <b>second metatarsal</b> is the longest. Each metatarsal has a base (proximally), a shaft, and a head(distally). The bases of the metatarsals articulate with the cuneiform and cuboid bones, and the heads articulate with the proximal phalanges. The bases of the first and fifth metatarsals have large tuberosities; the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal projects over the lateral margin of the cuboid.</br></br>
							<h2> PHALANGES</h2></br>
							There are 14 phalanges. The first digit (great toe) has two phalanges (proximal and distal); the other four digits have three each: proximal, middle, and distal. Each phalanx has a base(proximally), a shaft, and a head (distally).

							<b>Spinal Cord</b> is basically the "information highway of the body", messages are sent back and forth between the brain and the rest of the body. This information includes touch, temperature, pain, joint position and signals telling muscles to move. It Is Due to Our Spinal Cord that we can perform Reflex Actions, during the time of an emergency the signals instead of going to our brain go to the spinal cord so that the time lapse decreases. Spinal Cord Helps us to be straight unlike other mammals who are not able to stand straight as well as sleep on their backs. The spinal cord is comprised of neural pathways. In order for a message to go from the brain to the body, that message, or impulse, is passed from neuron to neuron through junctions called synapses. This process continues until the message reaches its final destination, such as muscle, gland, or other non-neural cell. <br/><br/>
							The central nervous system is organized in a way that allows certain parts of the spinal cord to control and affect certain parts of the body. Messages transmitting pain, movement, temperature, touch, and vibration regarding the skin, joints, muscles, and internal organs are all relayed through the spinal cord. <br/><br/>
							Spinal cord is one of the most important part of our body . Primarily spinal cord function include transmission to information and initiation of reflexes . In simple words the spinal cord help in connecting the various organs of body to the brain.

							<b>Rib Cage</b> has three important functions: protection, support and respiration. It encloses and protects the heart and lungs. It provides a strong framework onto which the muscles of the shoulder girdle, chest, upper abdomen and back can attach. It is flexible and can expand and contract by the action of the muscles of respiration. The diaphragm is attached to it's lower border. <br/><br/>
							The bones of the rib cage are the sternum, the 12 thoracic vertebrae and the 12 pairs of ribs. <br/><br/>
							The sternum is a flat bone that is made up of three parts, the (1) manubrium,(2) body, and the (3) xiphoid process. The top edge of the manubrium has a depression called the suprasternal or jugular notch. <br/><br/>
							All ribs are attached in back to the thoracic vertebrae T1-T12. In addition, ribs 1 through 7 are each attached in front to the sternum by a costal cartilage, and therefore called "true" ribs. Ribs 8 through 10, the "false" ribs are not attached to the sternum but to the costal cartilage of the 7th rib above. Ribs 11 and 12 are called "floating" ribs, they are only attached to the vertebrae.
