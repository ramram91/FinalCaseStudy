							 the kidneys are two brownish, bean shaped organs about the size of a fist, they weigh about 5 ounces. They are located in the upper right and left back part of the abdominal cavity. Each kidney contains about 1,200,000 microscopic filters called nephrons. Nephrons are smaller than the smaller dots.
							The main function or the kidneys are to maintain the water balance and to eliminate waste materials from the blood.

							<b>Ureter</b> is the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder. In humans there are two ureters, one attached to each kidney. The upper half of the ureter is located in the abdomen and the lower half is located in the pelvic area.  The ureter is approximately 12 inches long. The tube has thick walls composed of a fibrous, a muscular, and a mucus coat, which are able to contract.  Ureter disorders include: Duplication of the ureter: a congenital condition in which two ureters form on the same kidney. Ureteropelvic Junction obstruction: this occurs when the connection between the kidney and ureter is blocked, preventing urine from exiting the kidney. Ureterovesical Junction obstruction: When the connection between the ureter and bladder is blocked. If any of these disorders occur, the passage of urine is blocked and can cause pyelonephritis, loss of renal function, or renal calculi. Treatment is possible through insertion of a catheter, insertion of a stent, or surgery. If an infection is found, antibiotics are often prescribed.

							To prevent leakage, circular muscles called <b>sphincters</b> close tightly around the opening of the bladder into the urethra, the tube that allows urine to pass outside the body. The only difference between the female and male urinary system is the length of the urethra. In females, the urethra is about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long and sits between the clitoris and the vagina. In males, it runs the length of the penis, is about 8 inches (20 cm) long and opens at the end of the penis. The male urethra is used to eliminate urine as well as semen during ejaculation.
							Nerves in the bladder send signals when it needs to be emptied. The sensation to urinate becomes stronger as the bladder reaches its limit. At that point, nerves from the bladder send a message to the brain that the bladder is full, and your urge to empty your bladder intensifies. When you urinate, the brain signals the bladder muscles to tighten while simultaneously signaling the sphincter muscles to relax.<br/><br/>	
						
							The term urethral sphincter refers to one of two muscles used to control the exit of urine in the urinary bladder through the urethra. The two muscles are the external urethral sphincter and the internal urethral sphincter. When either of these muscles contracts, the urethra is sealed shut.<br/><br/>

							The external urethral sphincter originates at the ischiopubic ramus and inserts into the intermeshing muscle fibers from the other side. It is controlled by the deep perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. Activity in the nerve fibers constricts the urethra.<br/><br/>

						•	The internal sphincter muscle of urethra: located at the bladder's inferior end and the urethra's proximal end at the junction of the urethra with the urinary bladder. The internal sphincter is a continuation of the detrusor muscle and is made of smooth muscle, therefore it is under involuntary or autonomic control. This is the primary muscle for prohibiting the release of urine.<br/><br/>
						•	The external sphincter muscle of urethra (sphincter urethrae): located at the bladder's distal inferior end in females and inferior to the prostate (at the level of the membranous urethra) in males is a secondary sphincter to control the flow of urine through the urethra. Unlike the internal sphincter muscle, the external sphincter is made of skeletal muscle, therefore it is under voluntary control of the somatic nervous system.

							 the urethra is a muscular tube which carries urine from the bladder to the outside part of the body. In the female, it is a one inch long from the bladder to the cleft of the labia. In the male, it is several inches long from the prostate gland to the penis. When one is about to urinate, a value in the urethra relaxes to allow the urine to flow out.
