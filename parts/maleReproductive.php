						<p>
						<b> Note:</b> Other terms used to refer to the "Urinary System" include the "Renal System" and the "Genito-urinary System".<br/><br/>
							Each part of the urinary system performs important functions - both for the efficient operation of the urinary system itself, and also therefore, for the body as a whole. <br/>
							<h2>Functions of the Kidneys:</h2><br/>
							<b> Regulation of blood volume:</b><br/>
							The kidneys conserve or eliminate water from the blood, which regulates the volume of blood in the body.<br/>
							<b>Regulation of blood pressure:</b><br/>
							<b> The kidneys regulate blood pressure in 3 ways, by:-</b><br/>
							-	Adjusting the volume of blood in the body (by regulating the quantity of water in the blood - see above)<br/>
							-	Adjusting the flow of blood both into, and out of, the kidneys<br/>
							-	Via the action of the enzyme renin. The kidneys secret renin, which activates the angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. <br/><br/>
							<b> Regulation of the pH of the blood:</b><br/>
							The kidneys excrete H+ ions (hydrogen atoms that lack their single electron), into urine. At the same time, the kidneys also conserve bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), which are an important buffer of H+.<br/><br/>
							<b> Regulation of the ionic composition of blood:</b><br/>
							The kidneys also regulate the quantties in the blood of the ions (charged particles) of several important substances. Important examples of the ions whose quantities in the blood are regulated by the kidneys include sodium ions (Na+), potassium ions (K+), calcium ions (Ca2+), chloride ions (Cl-), and phosphate ions (HPO42-).<br/><br/>
							<b> Production of Red blood cells:</b><br/>
							The kidneys contribute to the production of red blood cells by releasing the hormone erythropoietin - which stimulates erythropoiesis (the production of red blood cells). <br/><br/>
							<b> Synthesis of Vitamin D:</b><br/>
							The kidneys (as well as the skin and the liver) synthesize calcitrol - which is the active form of vitamin D. <br/><br/>
							<b> Excretion of waste products and foreign substances:</b><br/>
							The kidneys help to excrete waste products and foreign substance from the body by forming urine (for release from the body).
							<b> Examples of waste products </b>from metabolic reactions within the body include ammonia (from the breakdown of amino acids), bilirubin (from the breakdown of haemoglobin), and creatinine (from the breakdown of creatine phosphate in muscle fibres). Examples of foreign substances that may also be exceted in urine include pharmaceutical drugs and environmental toxins.<br/><br/>
							<b> Functions of the Ureters:</b><br/>
							There are two ureters, one leading from each kidney to the urinary bladder. Each of these transports urine from the renal pelvis of the kidney to which it is attached, to the bladder (see diagram on the page about components of the urinary system).<br/><br/>
							Both of the ureters pass beneath the urinary bladder, which results in the bladder compressing the ureters and hence preventing back-flow of urine when pressure in the bladder is high during urination. This prevention of back-flow is important because when it is not operating correctly cystitis, which is inflammation of the ureter / urinary bladder, may develop into a kidney infection. <br/><br/>
							<b> Functions of the Bladder:</b><br/>
							The purpose of the urinary bladder is to store urine prior to elimination of the urine from the body.
							The bladder also expels urine into the urethra by a process called micturition (also known as urination). Micturition involves the actions of both voluntary and involuntary muscles. Lack of voluntary control over this process is referred to as incontinence.<br/><br/>
							<b> Functions of the Urethra:</b><br/>
							The urethra is the passageway through which urine is discharged from the body.
							In males the urethra also serves as the duct through which semen is ejaculated (see the section about reproduction for further detail about this function).

						<b>Rectum</b> is the concluding part of the large intestine that terminates in the anus. The average length of the human rectum may range between 10 and 12 cm. Its caliber can be compared to that of the sigmoid colon at its onset. However, it gets dilated near the anus, where it forms the rectal ampulla. Its key role is to act as a temporary storehouse for feces. The expansion of the rectal walls causes the stretch receptors within the walls to stimulate the urge to defecate. If the defecation process is delayed, it may result in constipation. When the storage site becomes full, the intrarectal pressure causes the anal canal walls to pull apart. This results in the feces entering the canal. A rectal exam may be conducted to diagnose certain diseases. Certain types of cancers may be diagnosed by performing an endoscopy in the rectum. Body temperature may also be obtained from the rectal area. In case of infants and babies, it can be a more accurate method to measure body temperature.

						<b>Male Urethra </b>connects the urinary bladder to the penis, and it functions as an exit from the body. Once the bladder becomes full, urine flows through the urethra and leaves the body at the meatus located at tip of the penis. The urethra is more than just a urinary duct; it also serves as a conduit for semen and sperm during sexual acts. While urine and semen travel through the urethra, the tube is not solely responsible for moving fluids. The urethral sphincter controls voluntary and involuntary urination. This group of muscles includes both the internal and external sphincter muscles of the urethra. The bulbospongiosus muscle of the penis plays an active role in ejaculation. The male urethra is comprised of four main parts. The preprostatic urethra runs in front of the prostate, while the prostatic urethra courses through that gland. The membranous urethra travels through the external urethral sphincter, while the spongy urethra travels the length of the penis and terminates at the meatus at the tip of the sexual organ.

							<b>Testicles / Testis</b> form part of the male reproductive system, and is the gland where sperm and testosterone are produced. The testes are contained in the scrotum and are composed of dense connective tissue containing around three hundred internal compartments called lobules. Each of these lobules contains a number of highly coiled tiny tubules where the sperm is produced. Testosterone is produced in cells located in between the lobules. Sperm travels through the testis from the tubules, through a network of ducts called the rete testis, to the epididimus. One of the most common complications that can occur with the testes is an undescended testis, which can occur in around three percent of all boys and around thirty percent of boys born prematurely. This occurs when the testes which form in the abdomen fail to descend to the scrotum, as they normally should, when puberty begins. This can be addressed by either waiting around three to six months after the initial examination for the testis to descend, or with a surgical procedure called an Orchidopexy, which involves artificially moving the testis concerned to the scrotum. The procedure is around 95 percent successful.

							<b>Seminal Duct / Ejaculatory Duct</b> - On each site of the prostate gland in the male reproductive system is an ejaculatory duct. Each ejaculatory duct is about two centimeters in length and is created when the seminal vesicle's duct merges with the vas deferens. At this point, these ducts travel through the prostate and, at its end, drain into the collicus seminalis's urethra. Semen flows through each ejaculatory duct during ejaculation, and travels through the penis to exit the body. One ejactulatory duct or both can become obstructed in a congenital or acquired pathological complication known as ejactulatory duct obstruction. When both ducts are obstructed, patients are likely to experience symptoms such as infertility and azoospermia or aspermia. Transurethral resection is a surgical procedure that can be used to open the ducts; its goal is to make regular ejaculation flow possible once again. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, which refers to an abnormal increase in prostate size, is another condition that can affect the ejaculatory ducts. Although this condition is correctable by surgery, an ejaculatory duct could be damaged in the process, causing retrograde ejaculation.

							<b>Prostate gland</b> is a walnut-sized structure that is located below the urinary bladder in front of the rectum. The prostate gland contributes additional fluid to the ejaculate. Prostate fluids also help to nourish the sperm. The urethra, which carries the ejaculate to be expelled during orgasm, runs through the center of the prostate gland.
