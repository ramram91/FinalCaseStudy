							<b>Aqueous Humor</b> - The aqueous humor is a watery substance that fills the eye. It is split into two chambers. The anterior chamber is located in front of the iris, and the posterior chamber is directly behind it. These layers allow the eye to maintain its shape. This liquid is drained through the Schlemm canal so that any buildup in the eye can be removed. If the patient's aqueous humor is not draining properly, they can develop glaucoma.<br/><br/>
							<b>Choroid</b> – The choroid lies between the retina and the sclera, which provides blood supply to the eye. Just like any other portion of the body, the blood supply gives nutrition to the various parts of the eye.<br/><br/>
							<b>Ciliary Body</b> – Ciliary body is a ring-shaped tissue which holds and controls the movement of the eye lens, and thus, it helps to control the shape of the lens.<br/>
							<b>Conjunctiva Glands</b> - These are layers of mucus which help keep the outside of the eye moist. If the eye dries out it can become itchy and painful. It can also become more susceptible to damage or infection. If the conjunctiva glands become infected the patient will develop "pink eye."<br/><br/>				
							<b>Cornea</b> - The cornea is the outer covering of the eye. This dome-shaped layer protects your eye from elements that could cause damage to the inner parts of the eye. There are several layers of the cornea, creating a tough layer that provides additional protection. These layers regenerate very quickly, helping the eye to eliminate damage more easily. The cornea also allows the eye to properly focus on light more effectively. Those who are having trouble focusing their eyes properly can have their corneas surgically reshaped to eliminate this problem.<br/><br/>
							<b>Iris</b> - The iris is the area of the eye that contains the pigment which gives the eye its color. This area surrounds the pupil, and uses the dilator pupillae muscles to widen or close the pupil. This allows the eye to take in more or less light depending on how bright it is around you. If it is too bright, the iris will shrink the pupil so that they eye can focus more effectively.<br/><br/>
							<b>Lacrimal Glands</b> - These glands are located on the outer corner of each eye. They produce tears which help moisten the eye when it becomes dry, and flush out particles which irritate the eye. As tears flush out potentially dangerous irritants, it becomes easier to focus properly.<br/><br/>
							<b>Lens</b> - The lens sits directly behind the pupil. This is a clear layer that focuses the light the pupil takes in. It is held in place by the ciliary muscles, which allow the lens to change shape depending on the amount of light that hits it so it can be properly focused.<br/><br/>
							<b>Pupil</b> - The pupil appears as a black dot in the middle of the eye. This black area is actually a hole that takes in light so the eye can focus on the objects in front of it.<br/><br/>
							<b>Retina</b> - The light focuses by the lens will be transmitted onto the retina. This is made of rods and cones arranged in layers, which will transmit light into chemicals and electrical pulses. The retina is located in the back of the eye, and is connected to the optic nerves that will transmit the images the eye sees to the brain so they can be interpreted. The back of the retina, known as the macula, will help interpret the details of the object the eye is working to interpret. The center of the macula, known as the fova will increase the detail of these images to a perceivable point.<br/><br/>
							<b>Sclera</b> - The sclera is commonly referred to as the "whites" of the eye. This is a smooth, white layer on the outside, but the inside is brown and contains grooves that help the tendons of the eye attach properly. The sclera provides structure and safety for the inner workings of the eye, but is also flexible so that the eye can move to seek out objects as necessary.<br/><br/>
							<b>Vitreous Humor</b> – The vitreous humor is the gel located in the back of the eye which helps it hold its shape. This gel takes in nutrients from the ciliary body, aqueous humor and the retinal vessels so the eye can remain healthy. When debris finds its way into the vitreous humor, it causes the eye to perceive "floaters," or spots that move across the vision area that cannot be attributed to objects in the environment.<br/><br/>

							Also called the oral cavity, the mouth is the first part of thegastrointestinal tract (or alimentary canal). The boundaries of the mouth are formed by the lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth, and palate. The mouth contains the teeth and tongue and receives secretions from thesalivary glands. It performs three main functions, which have to do withdigestion, breathing, and speech.<br/><br/>
							<h1>Functions of the mouth</h1>
							<b>First</b>, the mouth is the place where food is taken in and where digestion begins (see digestive system). The mouth is adapted to receive food byingestion, break it into small particles by mastication, and mix it withsaliva. The digestive functions of the mouth include:<br/>
							•	Chewing, grinding, and mixing of food<br/>
							•	Formation of a bolus<br/>
							•	Initiation of digestive processes<br/>
							•	Swallowing<br/>
							•	Taste<br/><br/>
							<b>Second</b>, the mouth is a passageway between the pharynx (the cavity connecting the nose, mouth, and larynx) and the outside of the body. It can thus be used for breathing when the nose is inadequate, as happens, for instance, during strenuous exercise. <br/><br/>
							<b>Third</b>, the mouth plays a vital part in speech (see voice), because alterations in the shape of the mouth and the lips modify the sounds that are made by the vocal folds (vocal cords) in such a way that they become recognizable as syllables.
							Structure of the mouth
							The mouth, like many organs in the human body, is a hollow cavity. The part in front of the teeth is called the vestibule, while the part behind is the mouth itself. The floor of the mouth is formed from sheets of muscle tissue which are attached to the inner surface of the jawbone, ormandible. The side walls are formed by the cheeks, which are sufficiently flexible to allow the mouth to open and close. 
							The roof of the mouth is formed by the palate, a thin sheet of tissue which separates the mouth from the nasal cavities above. At the back, the cavity of the mouth joins up with the pharynx, while at the front it communicates with the outside through the lips. 
							Except for the teeth, the whole of the inner surface of the mouth is lined by mucous membrane. At the back, the membrane goes on to line the gastrointestinal tract, and at the front it is folded over to form the lips. <br/><br/>

							<b>Lips and cheeks</b> - The lips and cheeks help hold food in the mouth and keep it in place for chewing. They are also used in the formation of words for speech. The lips contain numerous sensory receptors that are useful for judging the temperature and texture of foods. <br/><br/>
							<b>Muscles of the mouth</b> - The various parts of the mouth have to make numerous finely controlled movements in order that we may eat and speak. These movements are all brought about by the many muscles which lie under the mucous membrane, and which are attached to the skeleton, often some distance from the mouth.<br/><br/>
							<b>Palate</b> - The palate forms the roof of the mouth and separates the mouth from the nasal cavity. The palate consists of two quite different parts. The anterior (front) portion, the hard palate, is supported by bone. The posterior (back) portion, the soft palate, is skeletal muscle andconnective tissue. Posteriorly, the soft palate ends in a projection called the uvula. During swallowing, the soft palate and uvula move upward to direct food away from the nasal cavity and into the oropharynx. <br/><br/>
							<b>Salivary glands</b> - The salivary glands are small glands, found in many parts of the mouth, which produce saliva. All of them lie beneath the mucous membrane. The largest salivary glands are the parotid glands which lie, one on each side, just in front of the ears. Other large ones are the submandibular glands, in the floor of the mouth, and the sublingual glands, underneath the tongue. Saliva moistens the food that we eat, which makes swallowing easier; it also helps in the digestive process, for it contains the enzyme amylase, which breaks down thestarch in food. <br/><br/>
							<b>Tongue</b> - The tongue, which is made up of muscle fibers, is attached to the back part of the floor of the mouth. When it is not in use, it lies between the teeth and the lower jaw. Its most important tasks are to move the food about in the mouth during chewing and to assist in the making of sounds during speech. On the upper surface of the tongue are a large number of papillae that provide friction and contain the taste buds. <br/><br/>
							<b>Teeth</b> - In the human, a complete set of deciduous (primary) teeth contains 20 teeth. There are 32 teeth in a complete permanent (secondary) set. The shape of each tooth type corresponds to the way it handles food. At the front are eight chisel-shaped cutting teeth, or incisors. Behind these are the four canine teeth, and behind these are eight premolars and 12 molars. <br/><br/>
							<b>Tonsils</b> - At the back of the mouth are two thin folds of tissue on each side which run from the soft palate above to the root of the tongue below. These folds are called the pillars of the fauces. There is an anterior (front) and a posterior (back) pillar on each side, and between these pillars lie the tonsils. The tonsils are two small glands made of lymphatic tissue. <br/><br/>
