							The posterior (or dorsal) branches (or divisions) of the spinal nerves are as a rule smaller than the anterior divisions. They are also referred to as the dorsal rami.
							They are directed backward, and, with the exceptions of those of the first cervical, the fourth and fifth sacral, and the coccygeal, divide into medial and lateral branches for the supply of the muscles and skin of the posterior part of the trunk.
							Shortly after a spinal nerve exits the intervertebral foramen, it branches into the dorsal ramus, ventral ramus, and rami communicantes. Each of these latter three structures carries both sensory and motor information. Because each spinal nerve carries both sensory and motor information, spinal nerves are referred to as “mixed nerves.” Dorsal rami carry visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from the skin and deep muscles of the back.

							The white ramus communicans (plural: rami communicantes, ramus means branch) is the preganglionic sympathetic outflow nerve tract from the spinal cord.
							Each of the thoracic, and the first and second lumbar nerves contribute a white ramus communicans to the adjoining sympathetic ganglion, unlike the gray rami which are located at each spinal level. White rami communicantes contain both myelinated and unmyelinated preganglionic sympathetic fibers, (GVE and GVA). The white ramus appears white because they are more myelinated than unmyelinated fibers unlike the gray rami.

						Each spinal nerve receives a branch called a gray ramus communicans from the adjacent paravertebral ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. The gray rami communicantes contain postganglionic nerve fibres of the sympathetic nervous system.<br/>
						<h2>Function</h2>
						Preganglionic sympathetic fibres from the intermediolateral cell column (lateral grey horn) of the spinal cord are carried in the white rami communicantes to the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic trunk. At a paravertebral ganglion, preganglionic sympathetic fibres may either:

						Synapse in the paravertebral ganglion to postganglionic nerve fibres, or;
						Pass through the paravertebral ganglion without synapsing, and therefore continue as preganglionic nerve fibres since they are yet to synapse.<br/><br/>
						The gray rami communicantes are the branches responsible for carrying both these types of fibres to their target destinations. Postganglionic nerve fibres from the paravertebral ganglia are carried directly to their effector organs through spinal nerves, while preganglionic nerve fibres are carried to the prevertebral ganglia. At the prevertebral ganglia the preganglionic nerve fibres carried in the grey rami communicantes synapse to postganglionic nerve fibres responsible for innervation of the pelvic viscera.

						Ganglionic influence can be specifically targeted to end organs as well as becoming part of a summating systemic response. If the response is the whole body response, as in sympathetic fight or flight, the signals are distributed to other spinal nerves by way of gray rami communicantes which serve as conduits between the spinal nerves.

							Thirty-one pairs of nerves exit the spinal cord through openings in the vertebral column. These are spinal nerves. There are four main areas of the vertebral spine: the cervical spine, or neck; the thoracic spine, or chest; the lumbar spine, or lower back; and the sacrum, or tailbone. Below the sacrum, a small bone called the coccyx marks the end of the spinal column. The nerves that exit the spinal cord are named according to their corresponding region of the vertebral spine.<br/><br/>
							<h2>Sensory Function</h2>
							The posterior, or dorsal, roots of spinal nerves carry sensory information from the areas they serve back to the brain. Spine-Health explains that the area of skin from which a particular nerve receives sensory information is known as that nerve's "dermatome." 
							<b>For example</b>, the skin over the shoulders sends sensory information to the fourth and fifth cervical nerves, also known as C4 and C5. The C7 nerve detects sensation in the middle finger. The little toes send sensory information to the first sacral nerve. Pain or numbness specific to a dermatome could be a symptom of damage to its corresponding nerves.

					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>
							<b>Dorsal Nerve Root</b>– also known as a posterior nerve root – is a main bundle of nerve fibers that branches off the spinal cord and goes to other areas of the body. Dorsal nerve roots are responsible for carrying signals of sensation (such as feelings of pain and temperature) from the body to the brain. The brain then processes these signals immediately, making you aware of the sensation. <br/>
							A pair of spinal nerves branches out from each level of the spinal cord, one to the left and one to the right. Naturally, a left spinal nerve serves the left side of the body and a right spinal nerve serves the right side of the body. There are 31 total pairs of spinal nerve roots that branch off the spinal cord, each one carrying a dorsal nerve root and a ventral nerve root.<br/><br/>

							At the innermost base of each spinal nerve root, therefore, there are two sub-roots—the dorsal nerve root and the ventral nerve root—that connect the nerve to the white and gray matter of the spinal cord. The dorsal nerve root receives sensory, or touch, signals from the body and carries these signals to the brain, while the ventral nerve root sends out signals of movement from the brain to the body.<br/><br/>

							Technically speaking, then, the dorsal nerve root is an afferent root, meaning it carries neural signals from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to the central nervous system (CNS). The ventral rootis an efferent root, meaning it carries signals from the central nervous system (CNS) to the peripheral nervous system (PNS).<br/><br/>
							<b>Some important points to keep in mind about the dorsal nerve root include:</b><br/> <br/>

							- It controls pain and temperature sensations. <br/>
							- If severed, pinched or constricted, the signals of a dorsal nerve root will be intensified or interrupted. This can cause pain, numbness, a “pins and needles” sensation or the sensation of heat along the affected nerve. <br/>
							- It is extremely vulnerable in the foramen, or open space of each vertebra where nerve roots travel between the spinal cord and the rest of the body. <br/><br/>
							
							The foramen is the passageway for the nerves, so any disc damage or bone spurs that constrict this passageway can directly affect the nerve. <br/>

							<b>Ventral Root</b> is a type of nerve root that branches off the spinal cord, exits the spinal column and continues on its path to specific areas of the body.<br/>

							At each level of the spinal cord, two nerve roots branch out, one to the left and one to the right. At the innermost base of each spinal nerve there are two roots, the ventral root (also called anterior root), and the dorsal root (also called the posterior root). <br/><br/>
							The ventral root is an efferent root, meaning it carries neural signals away from the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and toward the limbs and organs. The dorsal root is an afferent root, meaning it carries neural signals from the limbs and organs back to the spinal cord and brain.<br/><br/>

							The dorsal root contains sensory fibers that control information like pain and temperature sensations, while the ventral root is made up of motor fibers that send electrochemical signals to the body’s muscles and glands.<br/><br/>
							<b>These impulses control the following:</b><br/>

							- Muscular contractions<br/>
							- Hormone synthesis<br/>
							- Gland secretion<br/><br/>
							There are several conditions that can lead to damage or constriction of a ventral root as it exits the spinal column. One example is foraminal stenosis, where the foramen (empty space between each vertebrae through which spinal nerves travel on their way to other parts of the body) begin to constrict or narrow. This constriction then puts undue stress on nerves passing through them, causing pain, numbness, tingling or, in acute cases, loss of some muscle functionality. Conditions that could cause foraminal stenosis include osteoarthirits, bone spurs, herniated discs or bulging discs.<br/><br/>

							If your physician has diagnosed you with a condition involving constriction of the ventral root, he or she may recommend physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, anti-inflammatory medication or steroidal injections. If these temporary treatments do not prove effective, contact Laser Spine Institute about our minimally invasive procedures that can help you find relief from pain. Laser Spine Institute will be happy to discuss your spinal condition and review your MRI or CT scan, completely free of charge.
