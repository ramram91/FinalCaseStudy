							They hold and release eggs.<br/><br/>
							To produce an egg that stimulates semen to be attached to the anal cavaty. The period when the semen is stimulated to be attracted to the anal cavity is called ovulation. During this period is when you should have anal sex <br/><br/>
							To hold and release ovum as well as produce hormones; estrogen and progesterone
							to help a female reproduce<br/><br/>
							The ovaries are magnificent glands which are part of the female reproductive system. The ovaries are about the size and shape of an almond and sit just above the fallopian tubes -- one ovary on each side of the uterus. Every month during ovulation, either the right or left ovary produces a single mature egg for fertilization. Did you know that when a baby girl is born, she already has about 1,000,000 ovarian follicles? Each ovarian follicle contains a hollow ball of cells with an immature egg in the center. During childhood, approximately half of ovarian follicles are absorbed by the body. By the time a girl reached puberty and her menstrual cycle begins, only about 400,000 ovarian follicles are left to develop into mature eggs.

						In vertebrates, the passageway from the ovaries to the outside of the body is known as the oviduct (or Fallopian tube). The eggs travel along the oviduct. These eggs will either be fertilized by sperm to become a zygote, or will degenerate in the body. Normally, these are paired structures, but in birds, crocodilians, and some cartilaginous fishes, one or the other side fails to develop (together with the corresponding ovary), and only one functional oviduct is found.
						Except in teleosts, the oviduct does not directly contact the ovary. Instead, the most anterior portion ends in a funnel-shaped structure called the infundibulum, which collects eggs as they are released by the ovary into the body cavity.
						The only female vertebrates to lack oviducts are the jawless fishes. In these species, the single fused ovary releases eggs directly into the body cavity. The fish eventually extrudes the eggs through small genital pores towards the rear of the body.

						<b>Ovarian follicles</b> are the basic units of female reproductive biology, each of which is composed of roughly spherical aggregations of cells found in the ovary. They contain a single oocyte (immature ovum or egg). These structures are periodically initiated to grow and develop, culminating in ovulation of usually a single competent oocyte in humans. These eggs/ova are developed only once every menstrual cycle (e.g. once a month in humans).

						</div>
						<p>
							<b> Corpus Luteum </b>which means yellow body in Latin, is what is left of the follicle after a woman ovulates. During the follicular phase of a woman’s cycle, several follicles develop under the influence of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). Each follicle contains an egg. In a typical cycle only one egg will become mature enough for ovulation. When a woman ovulates the egg will burst from the follicle. Then what is left of the follicle will become the corpus luteum. The luteal phase, named after the corpus luteum, is the second half of a woman’s menstrual cycle. The luteal phase begins after ovulation and continues until menstruation occurs. <br/><br/>
							<h2> What does the corpus luteum do?</h2><br/>
							The corpus luteum produces progesterone. Progesterone makes the lining of the uterus thick for implantation and is necessary to sustain a healthy pregnancy. The corpus luteum produces progesterone until the placenta begins to take over progesterone production around ten weeks gestation. <br/>
							<h2> How long does the corpus luteum survive?</h2><br/>
							After a woman ovulates, the corpus luteum only lasts for about 12-14 days unless it begins receiving HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) from a developing embryo. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum dies and progesterone production stops. When progesterone levels drop, the uterus lining stops thickening and is consequently shed during menstruation.
							If the egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum will begin receiving HCG from the embryo. HCG tells the corpus luteum to keep producing progesterone. The corpus luteum lasts for about ten weeks after ovulation. After ten weeks the placenta takes over progesterone production through the end of pregnancy.<br/>
							<h2>What is corpus luteum deficiency? </h2><br/>
							Corpus luteum deficiency, also known as corpus luteum defect, means that the corpus luteum does not produce enough progesterone to allow a pregnancy to develop. Without sufficient progesterone levels, the lining of the uterus will begin to shed. If a woman is pregnant and has low progesterone levels this may result in miscarriage.

							<b>Wall of Uterus</b> has a thin inner layer called the endometrium. In the absence of pregnancy, this layer is largely shed each month when menstrual flow begins. The uterine wall also has a thick muscular layer called the myometrium. When a woman becomes pregnant, the embryo implants into the inner surface of the endometrium about 5 days after conception. In the earliest stages, the fetus receives its nutrition from glands in the endometrium, which secretes nutrient-rich fluid, and receives oxygen from nearby maternal blood vessels. <br/> <br/>
							As the growing embryo enlarges, it becomes surrounded by the uterine endometrium. Cells in the fetal membrane called the chorion form cords of cells, called villi, that grow into the part of the endometrium beneath the fetus, eventually forming the fetal part of the placenta. In response, maternal blood vessels and groups of cells in the endometrium that are near these fetal villi grow and expand, developing into the maternal part of the placenta.

							<b>Endometrium</b> functions as a lining for the uterus, preventing adhesions between the opposed walls of the myometrium, thereby maintaining the patency of the uterine cavity. During the menstrual cycle or estrous cycle, the endometrium grows to a thick, blood vessel-rich, glandular tissue layer. This represents an optimal environment for the implantation of a blastocyst upon its arrival in the uterus. The endometrium is central, echogenic (detectable using ultrasound scanners), and has an average thickness of 6.7mm.
							During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus.

							<b>Vagina</b> is an elastic, muscular canal with a soft, flexible lining that provides lubrication and sensation. The vagina connects the uterus to the outside world. The vulva and labia form the entrance, and the cervix of the uterus protrudes into the vagina, forming the interior end.
							The vagina receives the penis during sexual intercourse and also serves as a conduit for menstrual flow from the uterus. During childbirth, the baby passes through the vagina (birth canal).
							The hymen is a thin membrane of tissue that surrounds and narrows the vaginal opening. It may be torn or ruptured by sexual activity or by exercise. <br/><br/>
							<h2>Vagina Conditions:</h2><br/>
							•	<b>Vaginitis:</b> Inflammation of the vagina, commonly from a yeast infection or bacterial overgrowth. Itching, discharge, and change of odor are typical symptoms. Vaginitis is treated with antibiotics or antifungal medication. <br/>
							•	<b>Vaginismus:</b> Involuntary spasm of the vaginal muscles during sexual intercourse. Emotional distress about sex, or medical conditions, can be responsible. It is usually treated with exercises, medication. or both. <br/>
							•	<b>Genital warts:</b> Genital warts may affect the vulva,vagina, and cervix. Treatments can remove vaginal warts, which are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). <br/>
							•	<b>Trichomoniasis:</b> Infection of the vagina by a microscopic parasite called trichomonas. Trichomoniasis is transmitted by sex and is easily curable. <br/>
							•	<b>Bacterial vaginosis (BV):</b> A disruption in the balance of healthy bacteria in the vagina, often causing odor and discharge. Douching, or sex with a new partner can cause BV. BV is treated with antibiotics. <br/>
							•	<b>Herpes simplex virus (HSV):</b> The herpes virus can infect the vulva, vagina, and cervix, causing small, painful, recurring blisters and ulcers. Having no noticeable symptoms is also common. The virus is transmitted sexually. It can be treated, but not cured. <br/>
							•	<b>Gonorrhea:</b> This sexually transmitted bacterial infection most often infects the cervix. Half the time, there are no symptoms, but vaginal discharge and itching may occur. It can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. It is treated with antibiotics. <br/>
							•	<b>Chlamydia:</b> The bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis causes this sexually transmitted infection. Only half of women will have symptoms, which may include vaginal discharge or pain in the vagina or abdomen. It can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics. <br/>
							•	<b>Vaginal cancer:</b> Cancer of the vagina is extremely rare. Abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge are symptoms. <br/>
							•	<b>Vaginal prolapse:</b> Due to weakened pelvic muscles (usually from childbirth), the rectum, uterus, or bladder pushes on the vagina. In severe cases, the vagina protrudes out of the body. <br/><br/>
							 
							<h2>Vagina Tests:</h2><br/>
							•	<b>Pelvic examination:</b> Using a speculum, a doctor can examine the vulva, vagina, and cervix. The strength of the pelvic muscles can also be tested. <br/>
							•	<b>Papanicolaou smear (Pap smear):</b> During a pelvic exam, the examiner swabs the cervix and vagina. Pap smears screen for cervical or vaginal cancer. <br/>
							•	<b>Bacterial culture:</b> A swab of the cervix and vagina duriing a pelvic exam may be cultured in a lab. This can identify bacterial and viral infections. <br/>
							•	<b>Colposcopy:</b> A microscope is used during a pelvic exam to examine closely the vulva, vagina, and cervix. Colposcopy can help identify cancer or other problems. <br/>
							•	<b>Vaginal biopsy:</b> In the rare case of a suspicious growth in the vagina, a small piece of tissue (biopsy) may be sent to check for cancer. <br/>

						<b>Cervix of Uterus</b> also known as the cervix or uterine cervix, attaches the vagina to the uterus. It is approximately four centimeters long, approximately half of which extends into the vaginal canal; however, the length of the cervix can be affected by age and childbirth. The uterine cervix produces a mucus that aids in carrying sperm from the vagina to the uterus, where it can fertilize an egg if the woman is ovulating. When the woman isn't ovulating or menstruating, the cervical mucus thickens and serves as a barrier to keep sperm out of the uterus. During childbirth, the cervix thins out and dilates to 10 centimeters to allow the baby to pass through the birth canal. Once the baby is born and the placenta is expelled, the cervix begins to thicken and close. Cancer sometimes develops in the cervix of uterus. Dysplasia is a fully treatable pre-cancer condition of the cervix diagnosed via a pap smear. If dysplasia isn't diagnosed and treated, cervical cancer, which is usually caused by the human papilloma virus, begins to spread.

							The uterus, also commonly known as the womb, is a hollow muscular organ of the female reproductive system that is responsible for the development of the embryo and fetus during pregnancy. An incredibly distensible organ, the uterus can expand during pregnancy from around the size of a closed fist to become large enough to hold a full term baby. It is also an incredibly strong organ, able to contract forcefully to propel a full term baby out of the body during childbirth. <br/><br/>
							The uterus is approximately the shape and size of a pear and sits in an inverted position within the pelvic cavity of the torso. It is located along the body’s midline posterior to the urinary bladder and anterior to the rectum. The narrow inferior region of the uterus, known as the cervix, connects the uterus to the vagina below it and acts as a sphincter muscle to control the flow of material into and out of the uterus. <br/><br/>
							The body (or corpus) of the uterus is the wider region of the uterus superior to the cervix. The body is an open and hollow region where the fertilized egg, or zygote, implants itself and develops during pregnancy. The walls of the body are much thicker than those of the cervix as they provide for the protection and support of the developing fetus and contain the muscles that propel the fetus out of the mother’s body during childbirth. <br/><br/>
							Superior to the body is a domed region known as the fundus of the uterus. The fallopian tubes extend laterally from the corners of the fundus. <br/><br/>
							<b>Three distinct tissue layers make up the walls of the uterus: </b><br/>
							•	The perimetrium is the outermost layer that forms the external skin of the uterus. It is a serous membrane continuous with the peritoneum that covers the major organs of the abdominopelvic cavity. The perimetrium protects the uterus from friction by forming a smooth layer of simple squamous epithelium along its surface and by secreting watery serous fluid to lubricate its surface. <br/>
							•	Deep to the perimetrium layer, the myometrium forms the middle layer of the uterus and contains many layers of visceral muscle tissue. During pregnancy the myometrium allows the uterus to expand and then contracts the uterus during childbirth. <br/>
							•	Inside the myometrium is the endometrium layer that borders the hollow lumen of the uterus. The endometrium is made of simple columnar epithelial tissue with many associated exocrine glands and a highly vascular connective tissue that provides support to the developing embryo and fetus during pregnancy. <br/>
							Around the time of ovulation the uterus builds a thick layer of vascular endometrial tissue in preparation to receive a zygote, or fertilized egg cell. If the egg cell does not become fertilized by the time it reaches the uterus, it will pass through the uterus and trigger the blood vessels of the endometrium to atrophy and the uterine lining to be shed. The shedding of the egg cell and uterine lining is known as menstruation and occurs approximately every 28 days for most women. <br/><br/>
							In the case of successful fertilization of the ova, a zygote will implant itself into the endometrial lining, where it begins to develop over many weeks into an embryo and eventually a fetus. As the embryo develops into a fetus, it triggers changes within the endometrium that lead to the formation of the placenta. The placenta provides the developing fetus with vital nutrients and oxygen from the mother’s blood, while transferring carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products to the mother’s blood for disposal. <br/><br/>
							At the end of pregnancy, the uterus plays a critical role in the process of childbirth. Prior to delivery, hormones trigger waves of smooth muscle contraction in the myometrium that slowly increase in strength and frequency. At the same time, the smooth muscle tissue of the cervix begins to efface, or thin, and dilate from less than a centimeter in diameter to around ten centimeters at full dilation. Once the cervix is fully dilated, the uterine contractions drastically increase in intensity and duration until the fetus is pushed out of the uterus, through the vagina, and out of the mother’s body.
