							<b>Rib Cage</b> has three important functions: protection, support and respiration. It encloses and protects the heart and lungs. It provides a strong framework onto which the muscles of the shoulder girdle, chest, upper abdomen and back can attach. It is flexible and can expand and contract by the action of the muscles of respiration. The diaphragm is attached to it's lower border. <br/><br/>
							The bones of the rib cage are the sternum, the 12 thoracic vertebrae and the 12 pairs of ribs. <br/><br/>
							The sternum is a flat bone that is made up of three parts, the (1) manubrium,(2) body, and the (3) xiphoid process. The top edge of the manubrium has a depression called the suprasternal or jugular notch. <br/><br/>
							All ribs are attached in back to the thoracic vertebrae T1-T12. In addition, ribs 1 through 7 are each attached in front to the sternum by a costal cartilage, and therefore called "true" ribs. Ribs 8 through 10, the "false" ribs are not attached to the sternum but to the costal cartilage of the 7th rib above. Ribs 11 and 12 are called "floating" ribs, they are only attached to the vertebrae.

							<b> Pharynx</b>, ( Greek: “throat”) cone-shaped passageway leading from the oral and nasal cavities in the head to the esophagus and larynx. The pharynx chamber serves both respiratory and digestive functions. Thick fibres of muscle and connective tissue attach the pharynx to the base of the skull and surrounding structures. Both circular and longitudinal muscles occur in the walls of this organ; the circular muscles form constrictions that help push food to the esophagus and prevent air from being swallowed, while the longitudinal fibres lift the walls of the pharynx during swallowing.<br/><br/>
								The pharynx consists of three main divisions. The anterior portion is the nasal pharynx, the back section of the nasal cavity. The nasal pharynx connects to the second region, the oral pharynx, by means of a passage called an isthmus. The oral pharynx begins at the back of the mouthcavity and continues down the throat to the epiglottis, a flap of tissue that covers the air passage to the lungs and that channels food to the esophagus. Triangular-shaped recesses in the walls of this region house the palatine tonsils (see tonsils), two masses of lymphatic tissue prone to infection. <br/><br/>
								The isthmus connecting the oral and nasal regions is extremely beneficial in humans. It allows them to breathe through either the nose or the mouth and, when medically necessary, allows food to be passed to the esophagus by nasal tubes. The third region is thelaryngeal pharynx, which begins at the epiglottis and leads down to the esophagus. Its function is to regulate the passage of air to the lungs and food to the esophagus. <br/><br/>
								Two small tubes (eustachian tubes) connect the middle ears to the pharynx and allow air pressure on the eardrum to be equalized. Head colds sometimes inflame these tubes, causing earaches and hearing difficulties. Other medical afflictions associated with the pharynx include tonsillitis, cancer, and various types of throat paralyses caused by polio, diphtheria, rabies, or nervous-system injuries

							<b>Larynx</b> (voice box) is part of the respiratory system that holds the vocal cords. It is responsible for producing voice, helping us swallow and breathe. Air passes in and out of the larynx each time the body inhales or exhales. Air from the lungs passes over the stretched vocal cords, and the vibrations are modified by the tongue, palate, and lips to produce speech. <br/><br/>
								It is composed primarily of muscles and cartilages that are bound together by elastic tissues. It lies between the pharynx (upper part of the air passages) and the trachea (windpipe), and forms part of a tube in the throat that carries air to and from the lungs. It consists of areas of tough, flexible tissue called cartilage, which sticks out at the front of the throat to form the Adam's apple. Below this, connecting the thyroid cartilage to the trachea is another cartilage that is shaped like a signet ring with the seal at the back of it. Just on top of this seal are two pyramid-shaped cartilages, and between these two cartilages and the inner surface of the Adam's apple stretch two fibrous sheets of tissue, called the vocal cords, which are responsible for voice production. <br/><br/>
								The larynx also has the important function of preventing choking. When we are not eating or drinking, the epiglottis stays upright, keeping the larynx open as part of the airway to the lungs; as soon as swallowing begins, the epiglottis drops like a lid over the larynx, directing food to either side. Closing the vocal cords also helps to protect the air passage. The food or drink passes down the esophagus to the stomach. The larynx is used when we swallow, talk, and breathe.

						<p>
							<b>Trachea</b>, commonly known as the windpipe, is a tube about 4 inches long and less than an inch in diameter in most people. The trachea begins just under the larynx (voice box) and runs down behind the breastbone (sternum). The trachea then divides into two smaller tubes called bronchi: one bronchus for each lung. <br/><br/>
							The trachea is composed of about 20 rings of tough cartilage. The back part of each ring is made of muscle and connective tissue. Moist, smooth tissue called mucosa lines the inside of the trachea. The trachea widens and lengthens slightly with each breath in, returning to its resting size with each breath out. <br/><br/>
							<h2>Trachea Conditions</h2><br/>
							•	<b>Tracheal stenosis:</b> Inflammation in the trachea can lead to scarring and narrowing of the windpipe. Surgery or endoscopy may be needed to correct the narrowing (stenosis), if severe. <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheoesophageal fistula:</b> An abnormal channel forms to connect the trachea and the esophagus. Passage of swallowed food from the esophagus into the trachea causes serious lung problems. <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheal foreign body:</b> An object is inhaled (aspirated) and lodges in the trachea or one of its branches. A procedure called bronchoscopy is usually needed to remove a foreign body from the trachea. <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheal cancer:</b> Cancer of the trachea is quite rare. Symptoms can include coughing or difficulty breathing. <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheomalacia:</b> The trachea is soft and floppy rather than rigid, usually due to a birth defect. In adults, tracheomalacia is generally caused by injury or by smoking. <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheal obstruction:</b> A tumor or other growth can compress and narrow the trachea, causing difficulty breathing. A stent or surgery is needed to open the trachea and improve breathing. <br/>
							<h2> Trachea Tests </h2><br/>
							•	<b>Flexible bronchoscopy:</b> An endoscope (flexible tube with a lighted camera on its end) is passed through the nose or mouth into the trachea. Using bronchoscopy, a doctor can examine the trachea and its branches. <br/>
							•	<b>Rigid bronchoscopy:</b> A rigid metal tube is introduced through the mouth into the trachea. Rigid bronchoscopy is often more effective than flexible bronchoscopy, but it requires deep anesthesia. <br/>
							•	<b>Computed tomography ( CT scan):</b> A CT scanner takes a series of X-rays, and a computer creates detailed images of the trachea and nearby structures. <br/>
							•	<b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan):</b> An MRI scanner uses radio waves in a magnetic field to create images of the trachea and nearby structures. <br/>
							•	<b>Chest X-ray:</b> A plain X-ray can tell if the trachea is deviated to either side of the chest. An X-ray might also identify masses or foreign bodies. <br/>
							<h2>Trachea Treatments</h2><br/>
							•	<b>Tracheostomy:</b> A small hole is cut in the front of the trachea, through an incision in the neck. Tracheostomy is usually done for people who need a long period of mechanical ventilation (breathing support). <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheal dilation:</b> During bronchoscopy, a balloon can be inflated in the trachea, opening a narrowing (stenosis). Sequentially larger rings can also be used to gradually open the trachea. <br/>
							•	<b>Laser therapy:</b> Blockages in the trachea (such as from cancer) can be destroyed with a high-energy laser. <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheal stenting:</b> After dilation of a tracheal obstruction, a stent is often placed to keep the trachea open. Silicone or metal stents may be used. <br/>
							•	<b>Tracheal surgery:</b> Surgery may be best for removing certain tumors obstructing the trachea. Surgery may also correct a tracheoesophageal fistula. <br/>
							•	<b>Cryotherapy:</b> During bronchoscopy, a tool can freeze and destroy a tumor obstructing the trachea.

						<p>							
							<b>Alveoli</b> have an elastic-like structure, which means that there is an amount of effort needed to inhale oxygen into the lungs, but that same structure assists with exhaling. The process of breathing is also made easier by a liquid that coats the alveoli and reduces the surface tension on the structures. This fluid is called surfactant, which reduces the surface tension by a factor of approximately 15. This allows the alveoli to inflate with a very small change in pressure. <br/><br/>
							<h2>Alveoli In Our Anatomy</h2><br/>
							At the end of each of the many tiny branches of our bronchial tree, we find openings to microscopic sacs. Each little sac is an alveolus, singular for alveoli. There may be several alveoli coming from one duct, forming a little clump. These groups of alveoli somewhat resemble a cluster of grapes that are all attached. It is in the alveoli that one of the most important transfers in our entire body takes place. It is here that the respiratory system comes into direct contact with the circulatory system, or blood vessels. <br/>
							<h2>Function Of Alveoli</h2><br/>
							We breathe in oxygen so that parts of our body can use it for many different cellular functions. But we must somehow get the oxygen from our lungs into our bloodstream, so it can be transported to the many places it is needed. Likewise, our bodies produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. It must be exhaled from our body, but must get from the bloodstream to our lungs. It is the alveoli that are responsible for this transfer of gases.

							As we head into the lungs, the trachea branches into two main sections, each called a <b>bronchus</b>. There is a right primary bronchus that goes into the right lung, and a left primary bronchus that goes into the left lung. Each of these bronchi (plural for bronchus) then branch into more bronchi. Those, in turn, branch into smaller tubes called bronchioles. All of this branching eventually results in a structure that truly resembles an upside-down tree. The trachea is the trunk, with all of the branches coming from it. For that reason, it is known as the bronchial tree.<br/><br/>
							Although this branching does not continue forever, it does happen about 25 times after the first branching of the trachea. The last bronchioles divide into what are called respiratory bronchioles, each of which divide into tiny openings called alveolar ducts. You can imagine how each tube has gotten smaller and smaller as it has branched. By the time we reach the alveoli, the tubes are microscopic - and there are millions of them!

							<b>Diaphragm</b> is the main muscle used in the process of inspiration or breathing in. It is a dome-shaped sheet of muscle that is inserted into the lower ribs. Lying at the base of the thorax, it separates the abdominal cavity from the thoracic cavity. It is a thin, skeletal muscle that can contract voluntarily. Located beneath it are the abdominal muscles. As the inferior aspect of the thorax, it is the means by which the thoracic cavity is increased. In order to expand the thorax, increase the vertical dimension of the chest, and decrease the air pressure in the thoracic cavity, this sheet of muscle has to flatten out by contracting. When the air pressure falls, air will rush into the respiratory tract. During contraction, the diaphragm pushes downward and pulls the pleura, a serous membrane surrounding the lungs, with it. This action causes the pleural pressure and the alveolar pressure to drop, which in turn, facilitates air to flow into the lungs.
